# Optimized-Rank-Adjustment-Sensitivity-Analysis
The non-linear and linear mathematical model is developed to perform sensitivty analysis within the ANP and AHP models by indicating the minimum criteria weight changes to make the second alternative the top-ranked one. This tool helps in evaluating the robustness of the rankings and the method used in a specific case study.  

After solving the model, the optimal decision variables, which are the changes within each criteria, are obtained. This model saves the time for the sensitivity analysis especially for the caases with the large number of criteria. the below graph is teh example of results for ANP and AHP SA models.

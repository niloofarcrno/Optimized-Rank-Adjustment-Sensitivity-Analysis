# Optimized-Rank-Adjustment-Sensitivity-Analysis
The non-linear and linear mathematical models are developed to perform sensitivity analysis within the ANP and AHP frameworks. This tool determines the minimum criteria weight changes needed to make the second alternative the top-ranked option. It aids in evaluating the robustness of the rankings and the method used in a specific case study.

Upon solving the model, the optimal decision variables—representing the changes within each criterion—are obtained. This approach significantly reduces the time required for sensitivity analysis, especially for cases with a large number of criteria. The graph below illustrates the results for the ANP and AHP sensitivity analysis models.

The tool developed for the ANP model is open access, leveraging the open-source solver IPOPT.
